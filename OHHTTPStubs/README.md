### Simple Temperature Retrieving Act Demonstrating Network Testing with OHHTTPStubs

This is the sample app used in my talk at Self.Conference.  It is using cocoapods, so don't forget to do a pod install and to open the .xcworkspace file.

The slides from my talk are available as a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15N9Zhjs_gN1Whae3NIJB3LOQ7lyEO9L_q1V7dH1LQ30/edit#slide=id.g2cf91d8a4_00).

Thanks to everyone who came!
